## demo
Demostration videos of building a project from scratch using tool_scratch and screenshots showcasing the goal monitoring user interface and other visual elements.


## demo_project 
A demo MotionActivatedLight project that can be executed without specific hardware requirements (e.g., a particular Arduino board), implemented on the basis of the MotionActivatedLight generated by tool_scratch.


## tool_scratch
An auto-generation tool for waterfall development, designed to first implement goal-monitoring functionality, followed by the development of application logic by the engineers.


## tool_legacy
